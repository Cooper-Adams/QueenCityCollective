This repository contains the code for the Charlotte sports news/blog website known as The Queen City Collective.

The site composition is a mixture of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Embedded JavaScript (EJS), with Express handling the routing capabilites. The database is a MongoDB hosted cluster, currently containing the articles.

The next large task to be completed is the addition of authorization. Content creators will have the only available log-ins, and after they log in they will have access to the admin article section of the site, granting the ability to read, write, update, or delete any new or existing articles within the database. This will be a separate view that is not linked on the site, and only accessible by typing it in the address bar.
